/**
 * Intuition
 *
 * A palindrome consists of letters with equal partners,
 * plus possibly a unique center (without a partner).
 * The letter i from the left has its partner i from the right.
 * For example in 'abcba', 'aa' and 'bb' are partners, and 'c'
 * is a unique center.
 *
 * Imagine we built our palindrome.
 * It consists of as many partnered letters as possible,
 * plus a unique center if possible.
 * This motivates a greedy approach.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *
 * For each letter, say it occurs v times.
 * We know we have v
 * // 2 * 2 letters that can be partnered for sure.
 * For example, if we have 'aaaaa',
 * then we could have 'aaaa' partnered,
 * which is 5 // 2 * 2 = 4 letters partnered.
 *
 * At the end, if there was any v % 2 == 1,
 * then that letter could have been a unique center.
 * Otherwise, every letter was partnered.
 * To perform this check, we will check for v % 2 == 1
 * and ans % 2 == 0, the latter meaning
 * we haven't yet added a unique center to the answer.
