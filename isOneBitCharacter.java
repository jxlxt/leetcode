/**
 * Leetcode Number: 717
 * Problem Name: 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
 *
 * @Input: bits = [1, 0, 0]
 * @Output: True
 * Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
 * So the last character is one-bit character.
 *
 * @Input: bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
 * @Output: False
 * Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
 * So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
